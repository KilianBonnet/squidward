# Api Documentation
## /GET /move?b=<board-content>
### Query syntax
The query argument `b` provides the current contents of the game board, using the following conventions:
- String of 42 characters
- The string should be built by scanning in column, starting from the bottom left corner
- Each character is taken among:

| Character | Representation      |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 0 (zero)  | Empty cell          |
| h         | Human player's tile |
| m         | AI's tile           |

For instance, the string `m00000h00000mm0000hmh000h00000h00000000000` represents the following board:
```
. . . . . . .
. . . . . . .
. . . . . . .
. . . h . . .
. . m m . . .
m h m h h h .
```
